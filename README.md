---
## Step Two: Split Columns
Column labelled, "Category & sub-category" needed to be split so we can futher clean and organize data

---
## Step Three: List categories
After more data cleaning, needed to see what categories were extracted from data before cleaning further
Created a category_df and a subcategory_df and then converted both to "category.csv" and "subcategory.csv" files, respectively

---
## Step Four: Clean labels
Column labels were not descriptive enough. Renamed columns for clarity and further cleaning

Created new .csv file called "campaign.csv" using this cleaned data
